				<h1>Revolutionary War</h1>
				<p id="specifictext">The American Revolution, beginning in 1775, had a united thirteen colonies facing off against the strongest empire at the time, Great Britain, for their freedom and right to representation in Parliament.
					The Declaration of Independence was signed and ratified on July 4, 1776, declaring that the thirteen colonies had seceeded from Great Britain and formed the United States of America as an independent nation.</p>

				<h2>Buildup to the War</h2>
				<p>Following the British victory in the French and Indian War, Great Britain had amassed enormous debt, thereafter the British Parliament imposed taxes on goods that were otherwise free in Britain like tea, sugar, and paper to pay off the war debt.
					This made the colonists unhappy because of their lack of representation in Parliament to argue against the unprecedented taxes, yet the British did not listen and continued to impose more tax acts on the colonies over time.</p>

					<figcaption>The Boston Massacre (March 5, 1770)</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>Colonial resistance and uprisings began to occur throughout the colonies against British soldiers, eventually leading to a violent breakout in 1770, when British soldiers opened fire on colonists, killing five men and injuring six others.
					In 1773, Samuel Adams and the Sons of Liberty decided to act against the British taxes by boarding three British ships in the Boston harbor disguised as Indians and dumped around $18,000 of tea overboard; this led to even more tension between the two sides, leaving no solution in sight.</p>				
				<p>By 1775, tensions between the colonies and Great Britain reached a boiling point, with both sides preparing for war. On April 18, 1775, 700 British soldiers were sent by General Thomas Gage to capture the munitions cache stored in the town of Concord and to arrest Samuel Adams and John Hancock, located in Lexington at the time.
					That night, Paul Revere and other riders warned the colonists and the local militia of the approaching British forces. The next day, on April 19, the British troops arrived in Lexington and were met by 80 militiamen led by John Parker, fighting would eventually break out between the two sides;
					throughout the day the militia and British soldiers would fight, and eventually the British would be forced to retreat back to Boston in a loss to the militia. The Revolutionary War had begun.</p>

				<h2>The Revolution Begins</h2>

					<figcaption>The Battle of Bunker Hill (June 17, 1775)</figcaption>
				</figure>	
				<p>Shortly after the colonies' victory at Lexington and Concord, the militia began to siege the city of Boston by surrounding the city and blocking land access to Boston.
					This militia would become the Continental Army led by George Washington, which was formed by the Second Continental Congress.
					During the siege, the British had planned to strengthen their position in Boston by fortifying the Charlestown peninsula which was a pivotal location due to its height to overlook Boston and its harbor.
					On June 16, 1775, upon learning that the British planned to send soldiers to fortify the hills in the area, colonial forces moved quickly to occupy the hills before the British, working throughout the night to build fortications on Breed's Hill.
					The day after on June 17, 2,200 British soldiers under Major General William Howe faced off against 1,500 militiamen led by Colonel William Prescott in the Battle of Bunker Hill.
					The British would eventually win the battle, taking the hills on the peninsula, but suffered heavy losses. The British lost 268 soldiers, while the colonists lost 115 men, showing that the colonists were capable of confronting and defeating the British forces.
					Although Washington's forces struggled through the winter to keep the British contained in Boston, they succeeded with the help of artillery captured at Fort Ticonderoga in New York, forcing the British to evacuate the city in March 1776.</p>							
				<p>On July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress voted for independence, and thereafter the Declaration of Independence was signed and ratified, with the thirteen colonies seceeding from Great Britain and forming the United States of America, yet the war for independence had only just begun as the British would come back with an even larger force to subdue the colonies.</p>

				<h2>British Counterattack</h2>
				<figure class="articlefloatr">

					<figcaption>The Battle of Trenton (December 26, 1776)</figcaption>
				</figure>	
				<p>George Washington moves his army from Boston to New York City in anticipation of an eventual British counterattack. The British would eventually arrive on Staten Island in late June with over 20,000 soldiers while the Americans only had 10,000 men to defend New York.
					By the end of August, British forces numbered up to over 30,000 men, and British assault began on August 22, forcing the Americans back after losing the Battle of Brooklyn, with the British capturing New York. 
					The following battles at Fort Washington and Fort Lee left thousands dead or captured, devastating the Continental Army's numbers down to a mere 2,000 men against the British's 35,000, forcing Washington to retreat across the Delaware River.</p>	
				<p>That winter, Washington revives hope for independence and launches a surprise attack on Trenton, New Jersey, on the day after Christmas, capturing 1,000 Hessians and enough supplies to arm multiple brigades.
					A week later, Washington uses his advantage to assault Princeton, successfully capturing the town and 200 British soldiers, giving hope for victory in the war to his men. Washington's army heads to Morristown afterwards to settle down for the rest of the winter.</p>

				<h2>The War's Turning Point</h2>
				<figure class="articlefloatl">
					<img src="img/Pic37.jpg">
					<figcaption>British Surrender at Saratoga (October 7, 1777)</figcaption>
				</figure>	
				<p>In Spring of 1777, the British planned to separate New England from the rest of the colonies to damage their morale. General John Burgoyne and his army planned to march south from Canada and meet with General Howe's forces.
					Burgoyne and his men dealt a significant blow to the Americans by retaking Fort Ticonderoga while Howe ignored the plans and marched his army south to confront Washington's army.
					Howe defeated the American forces on September 11, 1777, and captured Philadelphia, America's capital, on September 25.
					Washington attempts to recapture the city, but is defeated at the Battle of Germantown on October 4, 1777, and pulls his men back to Valley Forge for the rest of the winter.</p>
				<p>Howe's decision to ignore the plan had left Burgoyne's army weakened and exposed, and would eventually come into conflict with an American force under General Horatio Gates, fighting from September until British surrender on October 7, 1777, with the Americans capturing over 6,000 soldiers that day.
					This would prove to be a major turning point in the war as it proved to France that America had been capable of defeating the British, eventually leading to the French allying the United States and declaring war on Britain in June of 1778.</p>

					<figcaption>Valley Forge (Winter, 1778)</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>During the harsh winter at Valley Forge, hundreds of men would die from disease, yet the suffering troops would stay together from loyalty to their cause.
					Throughout the winter, Prussian military officer, Baron Friedrich von Steuben, would train and discipline the soldiers, improving their quality for the battles to come.</p>
				<p>After France's declaration of war on Great Britain, the British forces under Sir Henry Clinton abandons Philadelphia from the threat of the French fleet, and is pursued by Washington's army, eventually being caught near Monmouth, New Jersey.
					The battle ends in a draw while Clinton was successful in getting his army and supplies safely back to New York. Through 1778, Washington would continue to maintain pressure on New York City with his army through skirmishes.</p>

					<figcaption>Battle of Guilford Court House (March 15, 1781)</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>From 1779 to 1781, the Americans saw many setbacks in their war effort, losing Savannah, Georgia, and Charlestown, North Carolina to British forces, along with the defection of General Benedict Arnold to the British.
					Horatio Gates rushes to aid the southern states, but sees little victory, with his army being crushed at the Battle of Camden, losing half of his army from deaths or being captured.
					America would begin to see more victory from thereon, with an American victory against Loyalist militia at the Battle of Kings Mountain in early October; Gates is replaced by Nathanael Green as the army's commander in December of 1780.
					Under Green's command, America sees another victory at the Battle of Cowpens on January 17, 1781. Green then begins strategically retreating north towards the Dan River, staying ahead of Cornwallis' army. Now with more strength, Green recrosses the Dan
					and faces Cornwallis' army at the Battle of Guilford Court House, pushing Cornwallis' forces back to Wilmington, then marches north to Virginia to stop the flow of supplies to the southern colonies.
					Green then reenters the southern states, retaking Camden and engages in the Battle of Eutaw Springs, forcing a British withdrawal to Charlestown, where the British army is surrounded for the rest of the war.</p>

				</figure>
				<p>Cornwallis withdraws into Virginia and heads into the city of Yorktown in July, 1781, after the losses when facing against Greene's American forces; Cornwallis expects reinforcements will arrive to Yorktown by sea from General Clinton. 
					On September 5, 1781, French and British ships face off against each other in the Battle of the Chesapeake, leading to a decisive French victory, leaving Cornwallis cut off by sea in Yorktown.
					A combined American and French force laid siege to Yorktown on September 28, surrounding Cornwallis' army. Cornwallis is forced to surrender, and surrenders on October 19, 1781, leaving 8,000 British soldiers captured.</p>
					
				<p>After news of Yorktown had reached London, British Parliament began working out a treaty of peace with America and France, and a final treaty would be ratified on September 3, 1783, with Great Britain recognizing American independence.
					Throughout the eight years of the war, 25,000 American soldiers died, while 24,000 British soldiers would die in the greatest fight for independence and democracy in the world, with the United States persevering in the end.</p>
