						</a>
						<p>Following the catastrophic 9/11 attacks in 2001, The United States, under President George W. Bush began a War on Terror against Taliban and al-Qaeda forces located in Afghanistan,
							sending 30,000 American Soldiers to the unstable region; under the Obama Administration, troop numbers peaked in 2011 with 100,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, until slowly decreasing since then until in 2014,
							plans were made to permanently withdraw the military from Afghanistan.</p>

						<p>Although Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was unsuccessful in 1990 after losing to the US-led coalition, the Ba&#39;ath Party, headed by the Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, managed to retain power over Iraq.
							Following the Gulf War, the United Nations placed many economic sanctions and "no-fly" zones on Iraq. President George W. Bush issued an ultimatum to Saddam after the 9/11 attacks due to their risk of alleged possession of 
							weapons of mass destruction and support of terrorist groups. In 2003, the United States attacked Iraq sending around 100,000 soldiers, and with President Obama taking office, withdrawal from Iraq continued until a full withdrawal in 2011.</p>

						</a>
						<p>The ongoing War in North-West Pakistan is a conflict between Pakistan which is supported by the United States against Taliban and al-Qaeda forces in Pakistan territory.
							During this war, Osama Bin Laden was successfully killed by Navy SEALS during a military operation in Abbottabad, Pakistan.
							The United States also aids Pakistan through intelligence from drones and air strikes from the Air Force.</p>

						</a>
						<p>In response to the territorial gains in Syria and Iraq and the rapid development of the terrorist organization, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL),
							the United States began an intervention and formed a coalition of nations to combat ISIL. Since the beginning of the War on ISIL in 2014, the United States has launched multiple air campaigns against ISIL
							with over 24,000 airstrikes since then.</p>

						</a>
						<p>With the end of combat missions and the withdrawal of most American forces in Afghanistan in 2014, Taliban forces began a resurgence in the region near the end of 2014,
							forcing the United States to return focus to Afghanistan by increasing raids against militants in the area. Due to the increasing threat of Taliban forces,
							American soldiers are forced to return to the nation, with soldiers in the country increasing from 8,400 since the withdrawal, to 11,000 in 2017.</p>
